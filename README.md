# Line Following Robot 🤖

A line following robot built using **Arduino UNO** and **IR sensors**.  
This project was designed and implemented by [Aman] and [Rudresh Khunt] as part of a robotics challenge.  

## 🚀 Features
- Follows a black line on a white surface (or vice versa)
- Uses **8 IR sensors** for accurate line detection
- Controlled by **Arduino UNO**
- **L298N Motor Driver** for motor control
- Powered by a **3-cell 40C Li-Po battery**
- **3D printed chassis** for a lightweight and robust build
- Implemented in both **Arduino (.ino)** and **C++ (.cpp)** code versions

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Arduino UNO microcontroller  
- 8 × IR sensors  
- 2 × DC motors + 2 wheels  
- L298N motor driver  
- 3S Li-Po Battery (40C)  
- 3D printed chassis  

## ⚡ Working Principle
1. The IR sensors detect the contrast between the line (black) and the surface (white).  
2. Based on sensor inputs, the Arduino calculates the position of the robot relative to the line.  
3. The L298N motor driver adjusts motor speeds to keep the robot aligned with the line.
